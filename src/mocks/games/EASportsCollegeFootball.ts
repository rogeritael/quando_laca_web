    "The new franchise will deliver authentic college football experiences and the high quality gameplay that fans have long loved in college football games from EA Sports. Through the CLC partnership, the franchise will include the rights to more than 100 institutions featuring the logos, stadiums, uniforms, gameday traditions and more that fans have come to know and love. While this college game will not include student-athlete names, images and likenesses, EA Sports is continuing to watch those developments closely."
